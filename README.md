Simplicity Kiwisaver doesn't have an API so I'll get at my own data another way

# sharesies-api
Sharesies (https://www.sharesies.co.nz) don't have an API either, but I need my balance daily, so I'll go get it myself with Nodejs and Chrome, thank you.

Nodejs with Chrome Launcher - https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-launcher
and Chromeless - https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless
