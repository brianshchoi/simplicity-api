# Simplicity-api
Simplicity Kiwisaver doesn't have an API so I'll get at my own data another way using Google Puppeteer

# Sharesies-api
Sharesies (https://www.sharesies.co.nz) don't have an API either, but I need my balance daily, so I'll go get it myself with Nodejs and Chrome, thank you.

# Kiwiwealth Kiwisaver api
Kiwibank Kiwiwealth Kiwisaver (phew) doesn't have an API, can you believe, and we need our balance, so we'll go get it ourselves, thanks.

```apt-get install nodejs```

```npm install puppeteer```
