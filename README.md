## Simplicity-api
Simplicity Kiwisaver (https://simplicity.kiwi/) doesn't have an API so I'll get at my own data another way using Google Puppeteer

## Sharesies-api
Sharesies (https://www.sharesies.co.nz) don't have an API either, but I need my balance daily, so I'll go get it myself, thanks. 

## Kiwiwealth Kiwisaver API
Kiwibank Kiwiwealth Kiwisaver (phew) doesn't have an API, can you believe, and we need our balance, so we'll go get it ourselves.

## Westpac NZ API
Westpac NZ also doesn't have an API that allows us to get our balances automatically every 60 minutes for the kitchen Dashboard, so we'll go get them the old fashioned way, by scraping the page

```apt-get install nodejs```

```npm install puppeteer```


Still need to find a suitable was to secure the credentials, that'll be tomorrow's job
